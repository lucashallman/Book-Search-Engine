# Book Search Engine

## This is a refactored book search engine, which originially used a RESTful API and was refactored to use Apollo

## Description

"This project handles profile data and user searches using and Apollo server. It communicates with the server via queries and mutations which correspond to resolvers on the server side."



- The Problem I hope to solve: A RESTful app seeking to use Apollo

- The way I hope to solve it: By keeping the original layout and functionality of the app while refactoring only the server code

- Solving this problem was difficult for the following reasons: learning to format resolvers was a difficult process

- I learned the following: The important differences between different types of data manipulation
